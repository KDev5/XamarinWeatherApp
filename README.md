# Happy Weather

Happy Weather is a weather app developed in Xamarin Forms and C#. 

The application displays weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API. It displays the current weather as well as a 24 hour and 8 days forecast. 
It can display weather information at a specified location using the search function or by using the phone geolocation data to display information at the user's current location. The unit system can be switched between Metric and Imperial from the settings screen.
